          <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
            I’m a dedicated firefighter with a deep passion for serving my community and protecting what matters most.
            Off the front lines, I’ve developed a growing interest in web design — a creative outlet where I can build,
            problem-solve, and keep learning. Whether I’m responding to emergencies or exploring new lines of code, I
            bring the same drive, focus, and heart. Most of all, I’m a proud family person who believes in showing up
            fully — both at home and on the job.

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Experience</h2>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">
            As a firefighter with 20 years of experience, I’ve gained extensive knowledge and continuously worked to
            hone my craft. While I may not have as much experience in web design, I bring the same dedication and
            willingness to learn that has served me well in the fire service. I’ve completed a variety of courses to
            strengthen my programming skills, and I’m passionate about continuing to grow in this field.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            As a fire service instructor, I believe this commitment to lifelong learning is essential—not only for
            personal growth but also to effectively teach and inspire others.

            Aside from holding a certificate in 1001, I hold various certifications including Fire Officer and
            Instructor. The learning doesn't stop - I am always looking to level up because the learning never stops in
            this trade.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 leading-relaxed mb-4">In 2001, right after 9/11, I made the decision to join my
          local volunteer fire department. My father was a firefighter for about 20 years, so I thought "now" is a good
          time to carry the torch. I stayed on serving my community while working a fulltime job installing cable and
          Internet making a mediocre wage - enough to pay rent at least. That's when I started experimenting with web
          design, learning HTML and CSS. From there I progressed to other programming languages like Javascript and
          Visual Basic. I wasn't a huge fan of Visual Basic. I guess designing and programming computer programs wasn't
          my cup of tea so I stuck with web design.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 leading-relaxed">After about seven years I decided I needed more in my life.
          Something with meaning instead of installing cable and Internet. Something just clicked and I knew what I had
          to do - join the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). I did that for five years and consequently my wife decided it
          was time for me to stay home.</p>
